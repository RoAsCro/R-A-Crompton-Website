    <h4>Un Passant</h4>
    <p>Created for the final year project of my  Master's, Un Passant is a Java program for solving last <i>n</i> moves retrograde analysis chess problems,
        such as those found in Raymond Smullyan's 
    <i>The Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes.</i> The program can take a chess position and use layers of deductive reasoning to analyse the position
    and determine a. whether that position is reachable in a conventional game of chess, and b. what, if any, the last <i>n</i> number of moves were.</p>
    <p>The program uses a mix of depth-first searches with backtracking together with a series of complex heuristics to determine a board state's legality.</p>
    <p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/RoAsCro/UnPassant">here</a>.</p>
